    "article_text": "Written by Simon Harris Published: 6 June 2019 The 500 has been a big success for Fiat, so a fiery version of the model from Abarth – a separate high-performance brand within Fiat – is no surprise. Wearing the distinctive scorpion badges, the Abarth 500 has been significantly re-engineered and is only available through the small network of Abarth dealerships. Thanks to a peppy turbocharged 1.4-litre engine, it performs as well as the striking looks suggest. Sharp steering and minimal roll in corners make it hugely fun to drive too. For those who want even more performance, there’s an Esseesse version which increases engine power and adds stiffer suspension and better brakes. © 1972-2025 Bauer Media Group Bauer Media Group consists of : Bauer Consumer Media Ltd, Company number 01176085; Bauer Radio Limited, Company number: 1394141; Registered office: Media House, Peterborough Business Park, Lynch Wood, Peterborough PE2 6EA and H Bauer Publishing, Company number: LP003328; Registered office: The Lantern, 75 Hampstead Road, London NW1 2PL All registered in England and Wales.
