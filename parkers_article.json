Imitating the larger\n6 Series Gran Coupe\n, this new 4 Series Gran Coupe uses four doors, sharp looks and more space to offer the most complete package of the 4 Series range.\n\nThe BMW 4 Series with a hatchback tail\n\nAlthough the looks would have you believe this BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe is a sleek saloon the design hides the hatchback tail, which opens to reveal 480 litres of space. That’s the same as a 3 Series saloon, and 35 litres more than the 4 Series Coupe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more headroom for rear passengers as well, thanks to a roofline that is 12mm higher and 112mm longer than that of the 4 Series Coupe; the car’s length, width and wheelbase remain identical, however.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSculpted rear seats give the impression of individual chairs, but a 60/40 split (a 40/20/40 option is available) means the carrying space can be expanded to 1,300 litres.\n\nSeven engine choices\n\nFrom launch there are five engines to choose from. All will be familiar to BMW owners or aficionados. Those concerned with economy as much as performance will be interested in the 418d or 420d, the latter also the only model available with the firm’s xDrive four-wheel drive system from launch.\n\nThe range is bolstered by the 309bhp 435d xDrive and 254bhp 430d with choice of rear or four-wheel drive. Their power levels mean they’ll both struggle to match the incredible 61.4mpg (and 124g/km CO2) offered by the 418d Gran Coupe though.\n\nPurists will be more interested in the petrol engines, starting with the 420i and 428i four-cylinder turbos (with 181bhp and 242bhp) along with the range topping 302bhp 435i six-cylinder. Later the 420i will also be offered with the firm’s xDrive system.\n\nEfficiency and Dynamics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm’s EfficientDynamics range of fuel saving measures have been employed in the 4 Series Gran Coupe and every model benefits from lightweight construction, improved aerodynamics, brake energy recuperation, start-stop and certain components only activated on-demand . ECO Pro mode (first seen on the 3 Series) can reduce fuel consumption even further thanks to your improved driving style.\n\nThanks to the wider track and suspension layout from the Coupe, as well as specific adjustments and reinforcements to allow for the taller body and extra doors, the 4 Series Gran Coupe should handle just as neatly as the rest of the range.\n\nWhat you get for your money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquipment levels mirror that of the two-door 4 Series Coupe and every  4 Series Gran Coupe sold in the UK benefits from parking sensors,  heated seats, Xenon headlights, leather seats, dual zone air  conditioning, cruise control, Bluetooth and DAB radio.\n\nThe automatic tailgate is standard, but a smart-opener feature can be  specified at extra cost allowing for opening and closing of the boot  via a simple sweep of a foot under the rear bumper. Prices match the Coupe it’s based on.\n\n\nWe ran one as a long-termer – read more here\n\n\n\n\n\nReview contents\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\nOverview\n\nCurrently reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nPracticality & safety\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nInterior, tech & comfort\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\nEngines & handling\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\nOwnership cost\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\nVerdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW 4-Series Gran Coupe (14-21) rivals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudi\n\nA5 Sportback\n\n\n\n4.5 out of 5\n4.5\n\n\n4.5 out of 5\n4.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW\n\n3-Series Saloon\n\n\n\n4.4 out of 5\n4.4\n\n\n4.4 out of 5\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo\n\nV60\n\n\n\n3.5 out of 5\n3.5\n\n\n3.5 out of 5\n3.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraeme Lambert\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nOverview\n\nYou are currently reading\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nPracticality & safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nInterior, tech & comfort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nEngines & handling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nOwnership cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nVerdict\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to expand navigation\n\nTap to expand navigation\n\n\nOverview\n\n\n\n\n1 of 6\n\n\n\n",
